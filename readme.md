# Colmar Academy

Truth.  It's what sets us apart.  A top-shelf learning experience for a fraction of the price.  Let those other fly-by-night pop-up schools absorb your government-backed student loans and VA benefits while shackling you with massive debt and few prospects.  At Colmar Academy we'll absorb your loans too, but we'll send you out the other end educated and trained for a 21st century career.

## CSS Abstraction

Our faculty pride itself on segregation.  No, not that kind, the kind that allows reviewers of this project to easily see each part of the styling process.  With thanks to [Secret Punk](https://secretpunk.github.io/colmar_academy/), the style sheet has been separated into 4 parts: positioning, color, effects, and media queries.  This results in additional HTTP requests being made upon page load, but an HTTP request isn't grading this project.  A real person is.  A real person with places to be and other projects to grade.

## Positioning

We are a tech-forward university.  At the same time we don't just use every new framework that comes along.  Our public website makes heavy use of Flexbox to position our elements.  As a result our site collapses down to mobile gracefully without excessive re-coding.

## Fonts

A proper serifed typeface is a clear signal that education is a top priority at Colmar Academy.  For longer passages, serifs have been removed for ease of reading and accessibility.

## Color

At Colmar Academy we seek the truth.  As such we draw inspiration from the finest educational institutions in the world (and [bpmaiden's](https://bpmaiden.github.io/colmar/) use of hsla and the color wheel).  Contrast and tradition guide our palette.

## Animations

This is a serious place of learning.  If everything was jumping up and down on :hover how could we be expected to be taken seriously as a learned institution?  At Colmar Academy our site is conservative and polished in its use of transition effects.  A user should flow through a site like a crisp forest stream, not a Class V rapid.   Little touches such as underline effects and minor opacity adjustments bring the site to life without slapping the student in the face.

Slapping students in the face is not condoned by Colmar Academy.

## Responsiveness

We are proud of our diverse student body.  Our students utilize every kind device imaginable from desktops to smartphones and even tablets.  As such our site responds to four break points to ensure an ideal experience on every device.

## Accessibility

We believe in an inclusive experience.  One which even the visually impaired can appreciate.  Semantic HTML and ARIA roles have been added to improve the experience of these students, and a screen reader was installed and utilized for testing purposes.  In addition, descriptive alts were used to better capture the meaning of each image.  Finally as mentioned, serifs were removed from longer passages.

## A Note about the Developer

Our new frontend developer was trained at Code Academy's now defunct "Build Websites from Scratch" Pro Intensive course, and he wishes to express his gratitude to the moderators, students, and developers of the course.  We were initially skeptical to hire him since he only had ops experience (lame) but we hope you will agree he was up to the challenge.

## Conclusion

Since the dawn of humanity we have sought the truth.  Well, not us specifically since we were only founded a few years ago, but humankind.  We haven't been around *that* long.  You know what we mean.

Sometimes the truth is right there in front of us.  Other times it is shrouded in falsehoods and only through the passage of time is it brought forward for its proper recognition.  As a student of Colmar Academy you will learn to tell the difference.  As you consider advancing your education with us, we leave you with our university motto:

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
